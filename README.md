# Ridge Regression: Alpha vs R²

This repository is a **learning-focused project** that explains **Ridge Regression** and **regularization** using a simple synthetic dataset.  
The main goal is to understand how the **regularization parameter (alpha)** affects **model complexity, overfitting, and R² performance**.

---

## 📌 What You Will Learn

- What **Ridge Regression** is and why it is used
- The role of **alpha (α)** in regularization
- How **R² changes with alpha**
- Difference between **overfitting, good fit, and underfitting**
- How **coefficients shrink** as alpha increases
- How to visualize and interpret these effects

This project is designed **purely for learning and understanding**, not for competition.

## 📊 Dataset

- The dataset is **synthetic (generated using NumPy)**
- Non-linear relationship with added noise
- Created intentionally to demonstrate:
  - Overfitting
  - Regularization effects
  - Model generalization

No external data files are required.
